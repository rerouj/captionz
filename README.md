# Captionz

http://captionz.heroku.app

Captionz is a little application for analyse your Instagram captions. The principle is very simple : the app takes all your captions,it extract a corpus and then process simple statistics analysis. The app separates words from emojis and from hashtags then it makes simple natural language processing on the different corpuses. Because emojiâ€™s are complexe to extract, the analysis on the emoji corpus is not available for the moment. If you have other Instagram account, just logout and reload the captionz! main page.
